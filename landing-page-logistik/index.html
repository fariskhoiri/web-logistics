        <p>"A logistics company that specializes in intelligence trading, armed escort and covert transportation."</p>
        <p>
          Penguin Logistics is a delivery company made up of Messengers who will deliver the package to its destination "no matter what it takes." 
          However, Penguin Logistics also allegedly provides many other services, from armed deliveries to escort missions.

          Penguin Logistics has members that guided by a simple principle: go with the flow. As such, they never put much thought into what they will do next, instead focusing on the present moment. 
          This is also the reason for their misgivings.

            One of our most reliable logistics services is Armed Delivery. 
            Although we are not a military organization, we have several military weapons, ranging from light weapons such as lightsabers powered by originium to heavy weapons such as tanks. 
            No need to worry; we have official permission for the use of these weapons.

          <p>
            We are not only responsible for the delivery of valuable goods. We also have non-goods logistics services, namely armed escort. 
            This service is provided to other organizations and countries that require escort assistance. This service has been trusted by several large organizations in Terra, such as Rhodes Island, Blacksteel Worldwide, Rhine Lab, Rim Billiton and more. 
            And for countries, this service is relied on by large countries, such as Victoria, Columbia, Sargon, and the Ursus Empire.
